# HRMS Frontend - AB Enterprises

Human Resource Management System (HRMS) Frontend
Developed a responsive and interactive frontend for AB Enterprises’ Human Resource Management System using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. The frontend integrates seamlessly with a Python Django and Django REST Framework backend, enabling:

Employee management (add, update, view, and delete employee records)
Attendance tracking and leave management
Role-based access control for HR and employees
Real-time data fetching from REST APIs with Axios
Dynamic dashboards and charts for HR analytics using Chart.js

The interface emphasizes user-friendly design, performance optimization, and cross-browser compatibility, providing an efficient and intuitive HR management experience.

This system provides a centralized platform for managing employees, payroll processing, salary slip generation, employee records, attendance-related operations, document management, and administrative workflows through secure REST APIs.
